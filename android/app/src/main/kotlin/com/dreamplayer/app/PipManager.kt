/// Picture-in-picture for the **libmpv fallback engine**.
///
/// The main engine's pip lives in [ExoPlayerView] because it owns a native
/// `SurfaceView` and the live `ExoPlayer` instance. In fallback mode that
/// platform view is NOT mounted (the video is a Flutter texture rendered by
/// media_kit's `Video` widget), and `ExoPlayerView.enterPipInternal` gates on
/// `player.isPlaying` of an idle ExoPlayer — so the pip request would silently
/// bail out.
///
/// Entering pip is an Activity-level operation, so the same
/// `enterPictureInPictureMode` call works for a Flutter-texture video: the
/// whole Flutter window is shrunk into the pip window, and the player screen
/// already hides every control while `_inPip` is set, so only the video shows.
///
/// The auto-entry decision happens in `onUserLeaveHint`, which cannot wait for
/// a round-trip to Dart — so Dart PUSHES its playback state here
/// (`setMpvState`) whenever it changes, and this object answers synchronously.
///
/// The pip window's own transport controls are [RemoteAction]s (rewind / play
/// or pause / forward). A Flutter texture can't receive touches while in pip,
/// so these system-drawn buttons are the ONLY way to control playback there;
/// each one fires a package-scoped broadcast back to a receiver registered
/// while pip is active, which forwards to Dart.
